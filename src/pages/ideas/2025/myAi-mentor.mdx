### Project Type: Large

## Description:

A quantum-secure personal AI companion that revolutionizes digital life management. It creates an intelligent ecosystem that learns your communication patterns, manages your digital interactions, and protects your data with post-quantum cryptography. The assistant processes emails, messages, and calendar events locally, generating smart responses and actionable insights.
Users can integrate their preferred AI models (OpenAI, DeepSeek, etc.) while maintaining complete control over their data through zero-knowledge architecture.

This project will also be focused on exploring the need and understanding of data security of personal information(PI) in the AI world. For example - Before passing the context to the external LLMs, all PI will be anonymized. With MyAI, users will have full control over the information stored with us securely.

## Expected Outcomes:

- Neural learning engine for personalized responses
- Post-quantum encrypted data storage and cloud sync
- Universal digital life integration
- Voice and chat interface with minimal interaction
- Edge-first processing for privacy and speed
- Multi-model AI support with custom routing and features
- Smart task automation and scheduling


## Required Skills:

- Flutter  
- Python / LangChain  
- Local SQLite with encrypted sync  
- Post-quantum cryptography  
- Infrastructure: Appwrite  
- AI: Multi-model integration
