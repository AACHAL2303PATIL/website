### Project Type: Large

## Description:

Pregnancy is a life-changing journey filled with crucial medical appointments, tests, and healthcare decisions. However, expecting parents often struggle to keep track of these milestones, which can lead to missed appointments and added stress. Studies show that adherence to prenatal checkups directly impacts pregnancy outcomes, yet there is no universally accessible tool to assist parents in navigating healthcare requirements based on their country and trimester.

BabyNest is designed to solve this problem through a minimalist React Native app integrated with an AI-powered assistant. This intelligent assistant acts as a personal pregnancy planner and guide, ensuring that expecting parents stay informed, organized, and stress-free.

The app combines:
- A straightforward React Native interface showing essential appointments and tests
- An AI agent that helps plan and track important medical milestones
- Country-specific healthcare guidelines stored locally for offline access
  
## Expected Outcomes:

- Fully deploy the BabyNest mobile app.
- Optimize the AI assistant for better accuracy and response time.
- Improve system performance for a smoother user experience.
- Enhance UI/UX for better usability.
- Integrate country-specific healthcare guidelines for a personalized experience.

## Required Skills:

- Frontend Development (React Native)
- Backend Development (Node.js, FastAPI)
- AI and NLP (Python, LangChain)
- Database Management (SQLite, Pinecone)
